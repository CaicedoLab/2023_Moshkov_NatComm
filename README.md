        ├── 05-tables_for_HitRates_plot Generate tables with hit rates and top-rank hit rates. Used in the next notebook.
        ├── 06-Hit-Rates_EF Enrichment factor plots as in Supplementary Figure 7.
        ├── 07-assay_modality_AUC_plots Generate plots with correlations between training data size and AUC scores.

        ├── 11-Figure_auc R notebook to generate single assay ROC plots as in Figure 4. 
        ├── 12-Boxplots Generate boxplots for single and combined modalities. 


 # Figures to data-scripts-notebooks or dataset
 This section points to the data and code that was used to generate specific figures. Also, see the previous section for the description of the analysis notebooks.
- Figure 1B Can be generated with assay metadata `./assay_data/assay_metadata.csv`, which also can be found in the Excel file (see paper's dataset on Zenodo).
- Figure 1C This data is obtained with help of notebook `./analysis/03-generate_splits_and_UMAP.ipynb`.
- Figure 1D That is the final plot of `./analysis/02-dataset-filtering.ipynb`, similar plots can be produced with `./analysis/08-exceed_auc.ipynb`.
- Figure 1E Generated in `./analysis/03-generate_splits_and_UMAP.ipynb`.
- Figure 1F This data can be found in the Excel file (see paper's dataset on Zenodo).
- Figure 2A Generated in `./analysis/10-AUC_comparison.ipynb` with `predictions/scaffold_median_AUC.csv`.
